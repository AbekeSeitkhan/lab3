<h1>NeSteam</h1>
<p>  Hello, this is our project NeSteam. In our project we are using <strong>RAWG.io</strong> api. In this prototype we have only one fragment with adapter and request to api with games list.</p>
<p>Our Team members:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Seitkhan Abdirakhman 22B030141</li>
  <li>Kuspanov Dias 22B030145</li>
  <li>Daniyarov Madiyar 22B030532</li>
</ul>
<p>In future we are going to add 2 more requests. One of them will be used to search games by name. Maybe we will add creating new fragment to see more details about game.</p>
